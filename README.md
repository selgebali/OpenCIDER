### &#x20;                                   Is Open Data a global concept or a privilege?

To advance active participation in open data practices and to improve the quality of research, we need to adopt inclusive practices with particular attention to communities with limited resources to ensure equitable and effective engagement of underrepresented groups.&#x20;

To that end, OpenCIDER is a knowledge space where we highlight communities and resources related to several aspects under the umbrella of **Open Data** from a **global** perspective with a strong focus on Low-Middle Income countries (**LMICs**).&#x20;

We believe that enriching the Open Data community by propagating the foundations of equity, inclusion, sharing, and FAIRness on a **GLOBAL** scale, will provide significant benefits for research. It will also translate to more effective use of resources, increased rigor, transparency, re-use, participation, accountability, and reproducibility
