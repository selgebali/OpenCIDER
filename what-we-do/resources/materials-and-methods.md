# Pedagogical methods

> Know your Audience before choosing content, materials, and method of delivery.

There are different modus operandi in teaching that can be adapted to the type of event and audience needs and resources. Tailoring the teaching session to the audience is crucial in ensuring the success of the event. Examples of training methods:

* Martial arts dojo; a form of peer learning where new learners interact and work together to accomplish some tasks, before moving on to work together with more experienced learners/trainers/training assistants/etc... This allows for an exchange of experiences across all levels.
* Classical classroom setting
* Problem-based learning
* Peer learning
* [Learning by teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching)
* Ice-breakers

Examples of other approaches integrated in and beyond the "classical" teaching methods;
