# 🔍 The Survey!

To gain insight of the current computational landscape in different environments, we aim to launch a survey to assess the needs and requirements of individuals from different backgrounds by covering the following topics:

* 🛠 Which tools are used by researchers at different data life-cycle

  i.e. Planning, Creation/collection of data, Analysis, Sharing, Preservation.

* 🛠 Which tools are used by researchers in aid of improving computational inclusion such as those used in capacity building and training.
* 🛠 Which tools are used by researchers in community building and outreach. 
* 📎 Which computational tools do you need? What would you like to see developed?

If you are interested in surveying the digital landscape in your institute and/or would like to know more about existing tools and resources that enhance computational inclusion in academic research, please feel free to join 👏 [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S1Xcghi2Y7RqUCHcv6RTHtQogcSJVDb160SWDjnOcys/edit?usp=sharing)👏
